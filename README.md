A swiss army knife for development tooling in Foundry VTT.

## Features

- Provides a UI to toggle any Foundry Core CONFIG.debug flags, persisting the selection in the user's client settings.
- Provides an API to register and read a "debug mode flag" which is either a boolean or a number from 0 to 5 (log level).
- Provides a UI to toggle these flags on and off, preserving this selection in the user's client settings.

### Goal
Enable developers to stop putting debug code in their module code which accidentally gets shipped.

## TODO

1. Leverage the potential future `CONFIG.debug.moduleDebug` flag.
1. Implement other developer tooling. Have an idea? [Leave a suggestion!]()

## Installation

Module JSON:

```
https://github.com/League-of-Foundry-Developers/foundryvtt-devMode/releases/latest/download/module.json
```

## Configuration

| **Name**               | Description                                                                  |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Override CONFIG.debug? | Whether or not to use the dev-mode override settings for CONFIG.debug flags. |


## API

While active, after the hook `devModeReady` is fired, the following api methods are expected to be on `window.DEV`:

### `registerPackageDebugFlag`

```ts
async registerPackageDebugFlag(
  packageName: string,
  kind?: 'boolean' | 'level',
  options?: {
    default?: boolean | LogLevel;
  }
): Promise<boolean>
```

- `kind` defaults to `'boolean'`
- `options.default` is either `false` or `0` by default, depending on the `kind`
- Returns a promise which resolves true or false depending on if successful.

### `getPackageDebugValue`

```ts
getPackageDebugValue(
  packageName: string,
  kind?: 'boolean' | 'level',
): boolean | LogLevel
```

- `kind` defaults to `'boolean'`
- Returns the current value of your debug flag

## How do I actually use this?

### Step 1: Register your debug flag

If all you want is a simple boolean, this is as simple as doing this in your module's js:
```js
Hooks.once('devModeReady', ({ registerPackageDebugFlag }) => {
  registerPackageDebugFlag('my-module-id');
});
```

### Step 2: Read that value

Here's a log function I use which allows me to toggle on all of the stupid little logs I leave all over the place while I'm debugging.

```js
const MODULE_ID = 'my-module-id';

function log(force: boolean, ...args) {
  try {
    const isDebugging = window.DEV?.getPackageDebugValue(MODULE_ID);

    if (force || isDebugging) {
      console.log(MODULE_ID, '|', ...args);
    }
  } catch (e) {}
}

// ...

log(false, someVarToLog); // won't log unless my debug value is true
```

## Known ~~Issues~~ Features

- Any module which adds a custom key to `CONFIG.debug` will have that key show up in the `CONFIG.debug` overrides setting section.
